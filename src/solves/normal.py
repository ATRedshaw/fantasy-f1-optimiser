    """
    Perform a normal solve for the Fantasy F1 team selection with weighted price change.
    
    This function sets up and solves a linear programming problem to select an optimal team
    of 5 drivers and 2 constructors. In the optimization objective the expected points (xPts)
    are augmented by a bonus derived from each playerâ€™s projected price change weighted by
    a factor defined in the config file (config/solver_config.yml, variable 'price_change_weight').
    
    When printing the results, the reported total expected points (xPts) exclude the price
    change bonus (i.e. they only reflect the base xPts value).
    
    Args:
        projections (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing projections with columns:
            'name', 'is_driver', 'is_constructor', 'price', 'xPts', 'price_change'.
    
    Returns:
        None: The function prints out the team details, transfers, and optionally saves the team
        to 'data/team.json' with the remaining budget.
